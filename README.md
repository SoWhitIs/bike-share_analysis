## Overview of Analysis
Would a bike-share program be a good _move_ for Des Moines, Iowa? In this analysis, we review the business of bike-sharing with data from New York's bike-share program, CitiBike. 

Specifically, the source data of this analysis stemmed from August 2019, as this dataset provided an ideal use-case scenario to pinpoint trends and formulate strategies.

Considerations when reviewing said data included:
* The time of year, i.e., winter versus summer
* Peak Ridership
* Ridership Type: Subscribers, One-Time Customers
* When best to make repairs or maintenance?
* Most popular start and end locations?
* Ridership by gender, and by age:  who are the riders and what age is biking tends to be the most popular? 

In looking at opening the business in its totality the following ideas were also drafted, but not necessarily addressed in this analysis: 

* Barriers of Entry:
    * Start-up Cost: How much do _we_ need to get up and running?
	* Insurance
	Employees
    * Infrastructure: hardware and software
	* Permits
    * Competition, similar companies that may exist
    * Pricing Model: How do we determine cost? i.e.  Charge Per mile, by location length, Per Ride, Subscription Tiers
    * Where should bike stations be located? Start and end post?

## Summary

**Highlights:**

 * In August 2019, a total of **2, 344, 244 rides** were recorded 

* Of those  **_2M+rides_** : **1, 530, 270 were male riders**, **588, 431 were Female riders**, and the remaining **225, 521 riders were unknown**

* Peak ridership came between the hours of **6PM -10PM**, where the off-peak ridership ship (hours with the lowest counted riders) was between **2AM-4AM**

* Male riders appear to be among the highest amongst subscribers

* Female riders to tend travel or ride more during the morning hours of **7AM - 10AM** and evening hours of **5PM - 8PM**

* It would appear longer trips were had among riders with later birth years


**Should _we_ go for it?!**

Immediately, a bike-share program for Des Moines, Iowa would favor to be a good idea!  After all, _who_ does not like a good bike ride throughout the city, taking in the scenery along the way? 

Bike riding not only provides an optimal way to get around the city rather conveniently and quickly, but promotes a way to be more active, one pedal at a time.  Not to mention, the environmental implications of riding a bike as oppose to driving a car maybe most convenient. 

The environmental implications of riding a bike as oppose to driving a car are undeniably impactful.

But, the fact of the matter Des Moines, Iowa is a different landscape from New York City.  To continue expound on this idea even further it may be helpful to dive in more to the additional measures as ones pointed out in the [introduction.](https://github.com/SoWhitIs/bike-share_analysis/blob/main/README.md#overview-of-analysis)  

**_Pedaling_ forward**

Visual comparisons of data from different parts of the year, could, too, shed into light into the success of a bike-share program. For instance, ridership may be higher in latter first quarter to near end of third quarter, where we are in the Spring to Fall months, and weather is a bit more favorable. 

Primarily, answering questions like: are users still holding their subscriptions pass summer? In the relatively colder months were how long are trips? Do start and end locations popularity remain throughout the year?  What percentage of riders are tourist and locals? 

Gather more data! Take it to the streets! Ask local Iowans! Take a tour around the city to scout potential locations, including both heavily and low-traffic areas. _What is rush hour like in Des Moines compared to New York City?_

Begin to shape the data to show not only the success of the bike-share program, but a benefit to the city of Des Moines, including a possible Pilot Program.
